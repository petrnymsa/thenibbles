# The Nibbles

Semestral work of subject Programming and algorithms at FIT CTU.
Simple clone of classic game Nibbles. Made with C++ and ncurses library. 

*The game has three modes*
1. Player vs AI, which has three levels of "intelligence".
2. Hot-seat for two players.
3. Network game for many players. One of the players acts like as a server.
